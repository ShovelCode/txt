The purpose of this project is to develop a National Code for Code similar to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration's green book for trucking,
or the National Electrical Code (NEC).

The rules should be such that all programming jobs can be inspected by a third party and multiple teams can look at the same system and know how to follow
it from a standard "blueprint". UML is kind-of like this. Again, this type of regulation is yet-to-be-developed. Even the basic
principlesa are open to debate.

What I think so far:

Clean code
ISO standards througout
  Would this force open source? Would this be problematic?
Type-safety standards (sorry JavaScripters)
100% code coverage by tests
inspections of the tests

Problems right off the bat:
Should there be a list of approved languages, and thus all information systems written with other systems now deemed "out-of-code"?
Should there bea list of approved editors? Emacs and Vi mgith shine here.
Mandatory POSIX compliant Unix operating systems only?
