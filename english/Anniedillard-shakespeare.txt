How strange it is, this grand tapestry we call life, woven with words and moments, and yet so much of it colored with the indelible ink of one man: Shakespeare, the bard of Stratford-upon-Avon. In his works, we find the cosmos captured in iambic pentameter, the human heart explored in soliloquy and spectacle, the craggy outlines of love and loss rendered visible by the glow of a single candle. He breathed life into ink, conjured kingdoms from parchment, and summoned our deepest fears and wildest hopes in the simple rhythm of a sonnet. Like a hawk wheeling high above the English countryside, he saw us all – the lords and ladies, the knaves and fools – not as we wished to be, but as we truly are. We are caught, netted in the intricacies of his language, and in our struggles we come to know ourselves more clearly. The world continues to spin, seasons changing and years peeling away, yet in the timeless words of Shakespeare, we are forever tethered to the truth of our existence.
