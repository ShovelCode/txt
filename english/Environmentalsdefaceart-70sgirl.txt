Oh my gosh, like, you wouldn't believe what these environmentalists are doing! I mean, it's totally wild! They're all up in the museums and stuff, totally messing up these famous paintings. Like, whoa, right? It's totally not cool to ruin art, but they're all, "Save the Earth," and "Stop pollution," and stuff. And I'm like, that's groovy and all, but is this the right way to do it? 

And then it hits me, right, like a big wave at the beach. These folks are seriously freaked about our planet, man. I mean, they're scared our Earth is gonna become, like, this totally uncool, polluted place. And that's a real bummer. But it's just so far out that they have to wreck art to get people to listen. It's like, can't we keep both the art and the Earth looking fab? Now that would be really groovy.
