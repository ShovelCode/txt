In corners of the mouth where joy takes flight,
Bubbles the wellspring of pure delight,
It's laughter, pure, breaking the night,
A melody soaring, taking its height.

A whispering breeze that tickles the soul,
Chasing away shadows, making us whole,
In its magical grasp, we lose control,
Laughter, the language, where smiles enroll.

It leaps from the heart, a jubilant song,
Spreading like fire, contagious and strong,
In moments of mirth, where all belong,
Laughter, dear friend, to whom we throng.

It's sunlight dancing on life's clear stream,
A shared secret in a lover's dream,
In every echo, and every theme,
Laughter, the stitch in life's grand seam.

So let it ring out, free and unbound,
In every echo, let it resound,
In laughter, life's sweetest joys are found,
A symphony in happiness, profound.
