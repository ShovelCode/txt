(Interior, the kitchen. DOROTHY is making coffee. BLANCHE enters.)

BLANCHE: Dorothy, do you know what's wrong with this lipstick?

DOROTHY: (dryly) It doesn't come with instructions?

BLANCHE: Very funny. No, it's the wrong shade. Itâ€™s "Mysterious Mauve," but I asked for "Ravishing Raspberry."

DOROTHY: (sarcastic) Oh, the horror! An entire day without "Ravishing Raspberry." How will civilization survive?

(ROSE enters.)

ROSE: What's going on?

DOROTHY: Apparently, Blanche's lips won't be ravishing today. Just mysterious. 

ROSE: (earnestly) Oh no, Blanche, is that contagious?

(Blanche and Dorothy stare at Rose, then burst into laughter.) 

DOROTHY: (smiling) Only on the lanai, Rose. Only on the lanai.

(They all laugh and start their day.)
