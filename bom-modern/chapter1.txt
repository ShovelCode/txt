(1) I am Nephi, my parents were decent, my father taught me much of whatever he knew. I saw a lot of suffering in my life, all while being favored by God, as such I have great 
knowledge of God's goodness and mysteries, and so I am writing down these events.
(2) I am writing this in the language of my father, a creole of the Jewish and Egyptian languages.
(3) I testify that this record is true, that I have made it, and that I am using all my knowledge to write it.
(4) In the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, (my father is named Lehi and has lived in Jerusalem all his life), that many prophets emerged
and testified that the people should repent or else Jerusalem would be destroyed.
(5) So my father Lehi prayed with effort on behalf of all of us.
(6) Then as he prayed to the Lord a pillar of fire sat upon a rock in front of him. He saw and heard a lot and he greatly shook and trembled. 
(7) So then he returned to his home in Jerusalem and laid down on his bed and the Spirit inhabited him about the things he had seen.
(8) In a spiritual state he had a vision of God on a throne, surrounded by leagues of angles singing and praising God.
(9) Then he saw a really shiny angel descend, so shiny it was like the sun.
(10) He saw twelve others and they were as bright as the stars.
(11) They came down and flew around and then stood in front of my father and gave him a book that he recommended to read.
(12) He was spiritually inspired by it.
