My beard indicates I think in a Quranic way, even as an atheist. A bunch of mangled thoughts that come together to form a coherent paradigm. Trucking, trains, and ships move matter around the Earth. Concrete is dropped.
The flow and processing of solid matter. Plumbing is the flow and processing of liquids and gases. Energy and electrical work is the flow and transformation of energy, which makes the world economy a single
resource game like starcraft. Societies based on the status of plots and bodies of land like magic the gathering, and types of energy like pokemon. In these two games lies the major paradigm. The little
monuments to Al-Khidir are cute and Islam represents the necessary violent force required to preserve that which is valued. Computers are about the flow and processing of information. HVAC about the flow and processing
of human breathable air. Information then is essentially a fourth (or fifth if plasma counts) kind of "matter" which does not exactly have the finite properties of matter. All economies, peoples, and states are
slaves to art, all of them being the protective and reproductive systems (if the art is information) or the art itself (if one of a kind like a painting.)

Male and female are genres of art with bodies as the canvas. Like all art they are open to endless
reinterpretation.
