This is plain text in MacOS on M chips. I finally found it again.

Violence all the way down.

Fiction only demonstrates the stupidity and unthinking
Of its author.

The universe is the necessary violent coexistence of
Stupidity and intelligence, truth and falsehood, and beauty, and ugliness.

Philosophy is the process of straining the infosphere
In all its forms for Truth. 

Bullshit is necessary. Temples to bullshit are necessary.
People believing and acting out bullshit from cradle to 
Grave are necessary.

Information exists and may not be recorded, or solidified.

The residents of Sentinel Island are generating information
With each step they take, but without Fitbits attached to their wrists this information is lost to time, but it can
Be predicted.

The battery-sphere stores energy. Let them be filled and 
Used in a sinusoidal pattern.
