GitHub announced last year while I was distracted from coding that they will be storing candidate repositories on SvalBard island where the emergency seed vault is kept. The code will be kept in containers of microfilm that can be held at least 1000 years.



This is a lot of what I have been saying, and it is an important start to preserving source code, though no necessarily all the ROMs that have ever been made. These all still require Ekklesias. What new religion could sprout out 1000 years from now from some obscure repository today?
