I have mentioned before of text seeds and how media franchises and religion are the same. This set of things I have been describing also includes any social ligament people have. Imagine a meeting of a group of believers of a religion you disagree with, and political group you disagree with, and a fan meetup of a media franchise you don’t care for. They do the same. They sit, discuss the written body of language that they have accumulated, add to it and comment on it, and then go home. In most political meetings most of what gets done is a bunch of people sitting around agreeing with us. Social media can act as this as well. Toxic ideology (a form of virtual reality as Žižek has explained, makes us see things that are not real. The “real world” is not possible to view. That which drives a mass shooter, terrorist, and many depressed people is the toxic paradigm created by the text seed communities they participate in, with social media they don’t even need to have a book, just a bunch of sentences floating in the void of nihilism. This is comforting because it means that organized movements aren’t really that organized, it’s just a bunch of people sitting around agreeing with each other. The different communities as oblivious to eachother as the Church and Mosque next to each other. They may softly anti-value each other but they both get to exist. This is the virtual reality crafted by the bodies of language that are copied down through time, they create value and anti-value systems. What will survive? It’s an odd zoo of information out there.
